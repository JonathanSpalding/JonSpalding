# DevMtnFinalProject

This is my final project for DevMountain.

It's a website for frisbee golfers. Right now it's got three pages.

The home page just gives some info about the site and what you can do.

The profile page is where you can enter info about your matches played.

The courses page is where you can view info about local frisbee golf pages.
